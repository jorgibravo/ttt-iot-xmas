We are going to Create our another API to get the status of the LEDStrip that returns the activeAnimation
We should follow the same approach that we used in the previous step:

- Create Swagger Design
- Create Routing with Express
- Write Function to return the data
- Export the function

> Test with
```
yarn start
```
