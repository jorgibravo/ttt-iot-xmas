We are going to Create our another API to set the speed of the Animation
We should follow the same approach that we used in the previous step:

- Create Swagger Design for setLightSpeed
- Create Routing with Express
- Write Function to save the speed
- Modify status api to return the speed
- Export the function

> Test with
```
yarn start
```
